# Risk Management Framework

## Overview

Risk management is a critical component of the HFT system, ensuring that the system operates within predefined risk limits and complies with regulatory requirements. It continuously monitors exposure, enforces limits, and performs stress testing.

### Key Components

1. **Risk Limits**:
   - Defines position size limits, maximum loss thresholds, and other risk controls.
   - Implemented in `risk_management/limits.py`.

2. **Real-Time Monitoring**:
   - Continuously tracks open positions, market exposure, and system performance.
   - If thresholds are exceeded, the system triggers predefined actions.
   - File: `risk_management/real_time_monitoring.py`.

3. **Compliance Checks**:
   - Ensures that the system adheres to internal policies and external regulations.
   - File: `risk_management/compliance.java`.

4. **Stress Testing**:
   - Simulates adverse market conditions to evaluate system robustness.
   - File: `risk_management/stress_testing.cpp`.

5. **Reporting**:
   - Generates detailed reports for compliance and performance analysis.
   - File: `risk_management/reporting/report_generator.py`.
