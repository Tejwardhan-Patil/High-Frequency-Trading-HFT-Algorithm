# System Architecture

## Overview

The High-Frequency Trading (HFT) system is designed to operate in low-latency environments, enabling rapid decision-making and order execution. The system consists of several key components responsible for data ingestion, strategy development, execution, risk management, and deployment.

### Key Components

1. **Market Data Management**:
   - Handles real-time and historical data ingestion from various exchanges.
   - Data is cleaned, aggregated, and processed for further analysis.

2. **Trading Strategies**:
   - Implements multiple strategies such as momentum, mean reversion, arbitrage, and market-making.
   - Each strategy is modular and optimized for different market conditions.

3. **Execution Engine**:
   - Executes trades in low-latency environments using specialized algorithms (e.g., TWAP, VWAP).
   - Manages the full lifecycle of orders, from creation to cancellation.

4. **Risk Management**:
   - Enforces predefined risk limits and continuously monitors exposure.
   - Implements real-time risk checks and stress tests.

5. **Performance Analytics**:
   - Tracks performance metrics such as Sharpe ratio, drawdowns, and slippage.
   - Provides real-time and historical visualization of key metrics.

6. **Deployment**:
   - Supports cloud and on-premise deployments using Docker and Infrastructure-as-Code tools.
   - Includes support for AWS, GCP, and dedicated servers.

### Data Flow

1. **Ingestion**:
   - Market data is collected through the data ingestion pipeline.
   - Data is cleaned, aggregated, and stored in the system.

2. **Strategy Execution**:
   - Preprocessed data is fed into trading strategies for decision-making.
   - Execution orders are sent to the order management system.

3. **Risk Management**:
   - The risk manager continuously monitors positions and system exposure.
   - Any violations trigger predefined actions (e.g., halting trading, reducing exposure).

4. **Execution**:
   - Orders are sent to the execution engine, which interacts with brokers and exchanges.

5. **Monitoring**:
   - Performance and risk metrics are continuously monitored in real-time.
