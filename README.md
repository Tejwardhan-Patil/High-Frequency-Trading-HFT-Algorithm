# High-Frequency Trading (HFT) Algorithm

## Overview

This project is a High-Frequency Trading (HFT) system designed to handle the complexities of real-time market data, strategy execution, and risk management. The system leverages the strengths of C++, Python, and Java to ensure low-latency performance, flexibility, and robustness across different components.

C++ is utilized for performance-critical components such as order management, execution algorithms, and market data handling. Python is used for rapid prototyping, data analysis, and high-level strategy development, while Java provides a stable environment for managing risk, compliance, and certain trading strategies.

The system is designed for deployment in both on-premise and cloud environments, ensuring scalability and reliability in high-frequency trading operations.

## Features

- **Market Data Management**:
  - Organized structure for raw and processed market data, with specific directories for tick data and order book data.
  - Python scripts for data ingestion, cleaning, normalization, and feature extraction.
  - C++ implementations for low-latency data processing, ensuring real-time handling of market data streams.

- **Trading Strategy Development**:
  - A variety of trading strategies implemented across Python, C++, and Java, including momentum, mean reversion, arbitrage, and market-making strategies.
  - Backtesting and simulation tools in Python to evaluate strategy performance on historical data.
  - Optimization scripts to fine-tune strategy parameters using simulations and historical data.

- **Execution Engine**:
  - C++ components for managing orders, including creation, modification, and cancellation, with a focus on low-latency execution.
  - Python risk management tools to monitor and enforce trading limits.
  - Java and C++ algorithms for advanced execution strategies like TWAP, VWAP, and iceberg orders.
  - Broker API connectors in C++ for efficient communication with exchanges, supporting protocols like FIX and WebSocket.

- **Risk Management and Compliance**:
  - Python scripts to define and monitor risk limits in real-time, including position limits and stop-loss thresholds.
  - Java compliance checks to ensure adherence to trading regulations and internal policies.
  - C++ stress testing scripts to simulate various market conditions and assess the system’s resilience.
  - Comprehensive reporting tools to generate detailed risk and compliance reports.

- **Performance Monitoring and Analytics**:
  - Python scripts to calculate key performance metrics such as Sharpe ratio, drawdown, and slippage.
  - C++ real-time dashboards for monitoring strategy performance and market conditions.
  - Java-based anomaly detection to identify irregular trading patterns or market conditions.

- **Deployment and Infrastructure**:
  - Dockerized environment for deploying the HFT system, with configurations for both on-premise and cloud environments.
  - Infrastructure as Code (IaC) scripts for setting up necessary infrastructure, including Terraform scripts for cloud deployment.
  - Python scripts for deploying the system on AWS, GCP, or on-premise servers, with a focus on low-latency configurations.

- **Utilities and Helpers**:
  - A collection of Python and C++ utilities for time handling, logging, mathematical calculations, and configuration management.
  - Java utilities for loading and managing configuration settings across different environments.

- **Testing**:
  - Comprehensive unit and integration tests for Python, C++, and Java components to ensure system reliability and performance.
  - Automated testing workflows integrated with CI/CD pipelines for continuous integration and deployment.

- **Documentation**:
  - Detailed documentation covering system architecture, trading strategies, risk management, deployment processes, and compliance.
